#### This project is for the Devops bootcamp exercise for 
#### "Version Control" 

EXERCISE 1: Clone and create new repository

Clone git repository, creating a new local copy and
Push it to your own Gitlab remote repository.

git clone https://gitlab.com/devops-bootcamp3/git-project git-project-ku
cd git-project-ku/
git status
rm -rf .git
git init
git add .
git status
git commit -m "Initial git-project-ku"
    created rep https://github.com/EvgeniyKunegin/git-project-ku
git push --set-upstream origin master -  

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

EXERCISE 2: .gitignore

You see that build folders and editor specific folders are in the repository and decide to ignore it as a best practice.
- Ignore .idea folder, .DS_Store, out and build folders

Create–≤ file .gitignore
	.idea/*
	.DS_Store

Clear cash
	git rm -r --cached .DS_Store

git add .
git commit
git push

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

EXERCISE 3: Feature branch

Create a feature branch and change following:

- Upgrade the logstash-logback-encoder version to 6.6
- Add image to the index.html file (url: https://www.careeraddict.com/uploads/article/58721/illustration-group-people-team-meeting.jpg)
You are done with the changes. So:

- Check your changes using "git diff" and
- Commit them if everything is correct.
Note: There is a standard in your team to name commits with descriptive text.

- Push your changes to your remote repository.

Changed index.html 
get-diff

     <h1>Team member roles</h1>
-    <!-- add image here  <img src="" width="" /> -->
+    <!-- add image here  <img src="" width="" addad /> -->
        <img src="https://www.careeraddict.com/uploads/article/58721/illustration-group-people-team-meeting.jpg"  width="" />

git add .
git commit -m "Add img to index.html"
git push

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

EXERCISE 7: Revert commit

Still on the bugfix branch. You also noticed a spelling mistake in the index.html file, so you want to fix that in the same branch.

- Fix the spelling mistake and commit the fix
You also want to update the image.

- So also change the image url (src) in a separate commit.
You are done with the changes:

- Push both commits to the remote repository.


Your team members tell you the previous image was the correct one, so you want to undo it. But since you already pushed to remote, you must revert the change.

- Revert the last commit and push your changes to remote repository
